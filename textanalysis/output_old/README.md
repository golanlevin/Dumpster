- `catalog.txt` a list of filenames, used by `text.png` (for displaying the text clips)
- `corp.txt` the corpus, just the words and excluding symbols and rare words
- `corp_2g.txt` the corpus in 2-grams
- `distmat.png` distance matrix for the text clips. Excluded by git because it's too large
- `dsitmat_quant.png` lossy compressed version of distmat.png
- `distmat_sqrt.png` distance matrix, sqaure-rooted, for the text clips. square root so that the compression will be able to do less damage (high accuracy near the 0 where it matters). Excluded by git because it's too large
- `distmat_sqrt_quant.png` lossy compressed version of distmat.png.
