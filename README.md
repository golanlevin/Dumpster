### About *The Dumpster* (2006; restored 2013)
By Golan Levin with Kamal Nigam and Jonathan Feinberg 

*The Dumpster* (2006: [Golan Levin](http://www.flong.com/), [Kamal Nigam](http://www.kamalnigam.com/) and [Jonathan Feinberg](http://www.mrfeinberg.com/); restored 2013) is an interactive online visualization that attempts to depict a slice through the romantic lives of American teenagers. Using real postings extracted from millions of online blogs, visitors to the project can surf through tens of thousands of specific romantic relationships in which one person has "dumped" another. The project's graphical tools reveal the astonishing similarities, unique differences, and underlying patterns of these failed relationships, providing both peculiarly analytic and sympathetically intimate perspectives onto the diversity of global romantic pain.
